# Photon Playground

This is a sample app I'm using mostly to test out the Particle CLI functionalities.

## Command I've Used

- `particle list` - displays a list of my Particle devices & their IDs
- `particle compile photon src` - compile the src director for a photon
- `particle flash <IDENTIFIER> <FIRMWARE>` - flash a device with the given firmware
  - `<IDENTIFIER>` can be either a device name or ID
